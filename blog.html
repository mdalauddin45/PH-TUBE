                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Function Scope : </span>
                        Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are only
                        accessible within the function where they are defined.
                    </li>

                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Hoisting : </span>
                        Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
                        containing function or global scope, meaning you can use them
                        before they are declared, but they will be initialized with
                        undefined until their actual declaration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-base font-bold text-[#c51b46]">LET :</p>
                <ul class="text-sm list-disc ml-4 my-4">

                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Block Scope : </span>
                        Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are
                        accessible only within the block where they are defined. A block
                        can be a function, loop, or any code enclosed in curly braces {}.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]"> Hoisting : </span>
                        Variables declared with let are also hoisted to the top of their
                        containing block, but they are not initialized, so you can't use
                        them before their declaration.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-base font-bold text-[#c51b46]">CONST :</p>

                <ul class="text-sm list-disc ml-4 my-4">
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]"> Block Scope : </span>
                        Like let, const is also block-scoped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]"> Immutability : </span>
                        Variables declared with const are meant to be constants, and their
                        value cannot be reassigned after initialization. However, for
                        objects and arrays declared with const, you can still modify their
                        properties or elements; you just can't reassign the variable
                        itself.

                        null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any
                        object value or value in general. It is typically used when you
                        want to indicate that a variable or property should have no value
                        or that it has been intentionally cleared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">As a Placeholder :</span>
                        It can also be used as a placeholder or initial value that might
                        be assigned a value later in your code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Returned by Functions :</span>
                        Some functions or methods may return null to indicate that they
                        did not find a meaningful result.
                    </li>

                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Default Value :</span>
                        In JavaScript, variables that have been declared but have not been
                        assigned a value are automatically initialized with undefined. So,
                        undefined is often used as the default value for function
                        parameters and variables.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Property Access :</span>
                        If you try to access an object property that does not exist, you
                        will get undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Array Elements :</span>
                        When you access an array element that is beyond the current length
                        of the array, you get undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]">Function Return :</span>
                        If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns
                        undefined.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    A <span class="font-bold text-[#4BA2D3]"> REST API </span> is an
                    application programming interface that adheres to the constraints of
                    REST architectural style and enables interaction with RESTful web
                    services. Interconnected networks make up the web. A web service is
                    a set of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data
                    between client-server applications. Web services that follow the
                    REST architecture are known as RESTful web services.
